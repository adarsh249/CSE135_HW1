            <h3>Does the type of OS affect the page loading time for users under different types of network? </h3>

        <div class="firstp">
            <h2>Intro:</h2>
            <h3>    The loading time of web pages is a crucial factor of user experience,
                it directly affects the satisfaction and management of website users. In addition, load
                times are incredibly important to increase accessibilty.
                There are many factors that could impact page loading time, one of 
                the most important ones being the user network conditions users are
                accessing the internet from. We all know that 4G on average is much
                    faster than 3G, but could a certain operating system be more 
                    efficient on a type of network than another? In this context, it
                    is important to explore whether the type of OS affects the page 
                    loading time for users under different types of networks. </h3>

            <h3>The above grid shows a table of raw data we obtained from user 
                visiting our page. In this table we have their user sessionID, 
                operating system, network type, window dimension and their accepted
                languages. This is a good representation of where we draw our data 
                from. However, they are not presentable to users and it is hardly 
                compelling in such form, and that is why we perform the below
                visualization for our analysis. However, it is important to note that 
                this may help us learn more about a user since we would know their screen dimensions
                and possibly their geographic representation based off their languages. We also
                shredded the data down to include unique sessions only. These are all factors that 
                may possibly affect load times.

                MacOS and Windows and 
                each operating system covers a substantial amount of users. This is
                why we need to investigate this trend as operating systems such as 
                Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android have distinct architectures, 
                functionalities, and optimizations that can potentially impact the
                performance of web page loading.  </h3>

            <h3>    The above bar graph illustrates the variation in loading time solely
                based on the operating system. The information tells us that MacOS 
                has the fastest loading time followed by android, and the slowest 
                operating system was Windows. While this representation can provide
                valuable insights and be indicative of performance disparities, it
                is important to acknowledge the absence of network type. It is 
                crucial to consider that not all users have access to high-speed
                    internet connections or advanced routers. Therefore, the graph's
                    findings may potentially be misleading, as the impact of network
                    conditions on loading time is not accounted for, potentially 
                    underrepresenting real-world user experiences.

            <h3>    This graph is a more accurate representation of the real world situation.
                It is very obvious that 4G network users on average have a much faster
                loading time than that of the 3G users. However, there are some 
                variations among their operating systems. For example, windows are
                slower on 3G networks while they are faster on 4G networks. Macs 
                on the other hand are slower on 4G networks but faster on 3G 
                networks. Android on the other hand had too little data and we failed
                to analyze anything meaningful from it. Unfortunately, we are not 
                able to track IOS because of technical difficulties.

            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <h3>    The comprehensive evaluation of user performance is crucial for 
                driving improvements in our website. It is essential to move beyond 
                singular metrics such as operating system or network type and embrace
                a more holistic approach to obtain detailed and accurate results. 
                Given additional time to enhance the analysis, two key enhancements
                would be considered. Firstly, incorporating data for iOS devices 
                would provide a more complete representation of the user base. iOS has done
                a great job disabling any sort of tracking software, even when using Chrome on an iOS
                device. Having iOS data would better complete our metrics.
                Secondly, introducing an additional metric to track user device 
                performance would further mitigate potential bias arising from 
                variations in compute power. These augmentations would significantly
                contribute to a more robust and informative analysis, enabling 
                us to make informed decisions and implement targeted optimizations
                    for our website.
